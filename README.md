Project: Recipes (TOP)

Pre Project: 
- This is my first project in The Odin Project. 

- The objective is to build a basic recipe website with multiple pages connected using relative referencing through HTML links. 

- With this, I will be building my experience in using HTML and using Git to commit/push my work to Github.  

Post Project: 
- Acquired muscle memory for formatting an html-boilerplate
- Gained familiarity with html elements and attributes
- Learned how to format a website (without styling with CSS)
- Now understand Git, its command-line usage, what each step is for, and how to push to Github
- See the correlation from using Git in VSCode. 

CSS Update 1.0:
- Added a CSS stylesheet to the directory and added a link to each page
- Gained experience with styling, including different selectors, and attribute values in css
- Now comfortable with adding, committing, and pushing using Git for projects
- Learned how to use Git through VSCode and tested it out
