Project: Recipes (TOP)

Pre Project: 
- This is my first project in The Odin Project. 

- The objective is to build a basic recipe website with multiple pages connected using relative referencing through HTML links. 

- With this, I will be building my experience in using HTML and using Git to commit/push my work to Github.
