        <p>What is peach cobbler you ask? A cobbler is a deep-dish fruit dessert with a sweetened fruit filling that is topped off with a biscuit-like dough. The dough may cover the entire dish or be dropped by the spoonful, earning it the name "cobbler" for its resemblance to a cobblestone street. It is the same fruit-and-pastry combo in pie, but without all the effort!</p>
